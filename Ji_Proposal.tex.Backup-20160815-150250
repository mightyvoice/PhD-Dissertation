\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

This is my introduction. Here is an example of a citation using BiB\TeX{}
that cites the GNU project, a major force in free software advocacy
\cite{gpl}. The UNC Charlotte thesis guidelines state the following
about the text of thesis and dissertation documents:
\begin{quote}
``Do not use bold, underline or create unusual fonts for chapter
titles; do not use running headers or footers. Do not use bold, underline
or italics for headings, subheadings, etc. Changes in font style or
typeface are not permitted except for inclusion of illustrative or
documentary materials such as computer printouts or if required for
mathematical expressions. If you are unsure about the acceptability
of the typeface you want to use for your final copy of the thesis
or dissertation, please verify with the thesis/dissertation reviewer
in the Graduate School that it can be used.'' \emph{--~UNC Charlotte
Guidelines 2014: Thesis Text} (page 4)

\section{Problem Statement}

This is an example of a subsection. I have included Table \ref{tab:Table1}
and Table \ref{tab:Table2} as examples of how to place tables and
table cross-references in your document. I have also included Figure
\ref{fig:LinearFit} which has subfigures within it to provide an
example of a graphical figure in the document. Labeling tables and
figures and cross-referencing these labels in your text will ensure
that the list of figures and list of tables generated automatically
will always be correct even when you move figures and tables to new
locations in your document.

\appendix

\chapter{QUADRATIC FIT COMPARISON GRAPHS}

The appendices should be used for whatever material you or your advisory
committee believes should be included, but would not be appropriate
in the text of the thesis or dissertation. Such materials can include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the original data obtained in the thesis or dissertation research,
including computer programs and printouts, surveys, or correspondence;
\item detailed descriptions of procedures, which go beyond the general outline
of methods and approaches presented in the text;
\item a particularly extensive review of the literature and other information
that may be useful to future scholars who may wish to delve more deeply
into the research topic.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Section in appendix}

This is a section in the appendix.
\begin{vita}
If you decide to include a vita (a biosketch about yourself), you
would include the text of your vita here.

The thesis or dissertation may conclude with a biographical sketch
of the author. The sketch should be written in the third person and
should indicate birth date and birthplace, where the author earned
the bachelor's degree and if applicable the master's degree, professional
societies to which the authors belongs, and other professional activities.\end{vita}
